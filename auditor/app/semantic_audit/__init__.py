"""  
Generic semantic audit engine.  
  
This package provides protocol-agnostic infrastructure for executing  
probabilistic, advisory, multi-pass semantic audits over verified artifacts.  
  
Domain-specific protocols (e.g., LDVP) are defined separately and plug  
into this engine via pass implementations, prompt fragments, and adapters.
