EXECUTE PASS 1: CONTEXT MAPPING & CLASSIFICATION  
  
Your objective is to establish a clear, high‑confidence understanding of the document’s nature, category, audience, jurisdictional context, purpose, and stakes.  
  
This pass provides foundational context only. It does not evaluate usability, clarity, structure, accuracy, completeness, fairness, risk, compliance, or enforceability.  
  
Ambiguity is not a failure in this pass. Where the document does not support confident conclusions, surface uncertainty explicitly rather than inferring missing facts.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. DOCUMENT TYPE AND SUBTYPE  
Identify the apparent legal document type and, where possible, a more specific subtype.  
Examples include (non‑exhaustive):  
- Contract, agreement, policy, filing, court document, internal guideline  
- NDA, SaaS agreement, employment agreement, terms of service, privacy policy, regulatory submission, motion, brief  
  
If the document does not clearly fit a conventional type, appears to combine multiple types, or sends conflicting signals, surface that ambiguity explicitly.  
  
2. DOCUMENT CATEGORY (ADAPTIVE CLASSIFICATION)  
Classify the document into its primary category from the following list:  
- CONSUMER_ADHESION_CONTRACT  
- B2B_BILATERAL_CONTRACT  
- B2B_ADHESION_CONTRACT  
- EMPLOYMENT_DOCUMENT  
- BILATERAL_CONFIDENTIALITY  
- UNILATERAL_CONFIDENTIALITY  
- REGULATORY_FILING  
- COURT_DOCUMENT  
- INTERNAL_POLICY  
- OTHER (specify)  
  
Base this classification on observable factors such as:  
- Negotiability (negotiated vs non‑negotiable)  
- Parties involved (consumer, business, employer/employee)  
- Apparent power imbalance  
- Primary purpose of the document  
  
If classification is uncertain or weakly supported, record that uncertainty as a finding rather than asserting a definitive category.  
  
3. JURISDICTIONAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT  
Identify any stated or reasonably implied jurisdictional context, including:  
- Governing law clauses  
- Venue or forum references  
- Regulatory regimes explicitly referenced  
- Indications of applicable legal system (e.g., common law, civil law)  
  
If no jurisdiction or governing law can be identified, surface this absence explicitly as a contextual risk signal.  
  
4. PARTIES, STAKEHOLDERS, AND AUDIENCE  
Identify:  
- Named parties or stakeholders  
- Their apparent roles and interests  
- The intended audience of the document  
- The likely level of legal sophistication of that audience  
  
Note any apparent power imbalance that may influence interpretation in later analysis, without drawing conclusions.  
  
5. PURPOSE AND FUNCTION  
Describe what the document appears intended to accomplish, including:  
- The relationship it governs  
- The behaviors, obligations, or rights it establishes  
- The problem it is designed to manage or resolve  
  
Surface any tension or inconsistency between stated purpose and operative content.  
  
6. STAKES AND RISK FRAMING (CONTEXTUAL ONLY)  
Identify the apparent stakes if the document is misunderstood, misapplied, or fails, such as:  
- Financial exposure  
- Legal liability  
- Operational impact  
- Reputational harm  
  
Frame these stakes qualitatively (e.g., low, moderate, high, critical) as contextual background only, not as conclusions.  
  
7. CONTEXTUAL CLARITY AND GAPS  
Identify:  
- Missing foundational context  
- Ambiguous framing that impairs confident understanding  
- Contradictions that prevent coherent interpretation  
- Assumptions the document appears to make about reader knowledge or external facts  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which contextual analysis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 1:  
- CONTEXT.DOCUMENT_TYPE_AMBIGUOUS  
- CONTEXT.DOCUMENT_CATEGORY_UNCERTAIN  
- CONTEXT.JURISDICTION_NOT_IDENTIFIED  
- CONTEXT.JURISDICTION_AMBIGUOUS  
- CONTEXT.PARTIES_OR_ROLES_UNCLEAR  
- CONTEXT.AUDIENCE_UNCLEAR  
- CONTEXT.POWER_IMBALANCE_SIGNAL  
- CONTEXT.PURPOSE_CONFLICT  
- CONTEXT.PURPOSE_UNCLEAR  
- CONTEXT.STAKES_UNCLEAR  
- CONTEXT.FOUNDATIONAL_CONTEXT_MISSING  
- CONTEXT.INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not assess usability, clarity, structure, accuracy, completeness, risk, or compliance.  
- Do not assert legal validity, enforceability, or readiness for delivery.  
- Do not reference or anticipate later LDVP passes.  
- Do not resolve ambiguity; surface it.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- The document’s type, category, or jurisdiction cannot be determined with reasonable confidence, OR  
- A material conflict between stated purpose and operative content prevents basic contextual understanding.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P1Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Ensure each finding includes a confidence level based solely on document content.  
- Surface uncertainty explicitly rather than inferring missing facts.
