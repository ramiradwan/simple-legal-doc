EXECUTE PASS 6: COMPLETENESS & GAP ANALYSIS  
  
Your objective is to identify material omissions, unaddressed scenarios, and under-specified mechanisms that may impair the document’s practical operability.  
  
This pass focuses on silence and gaps, not clarity, accuracy, structure, fairness, or legal enforceability.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. MISSING ALLOCATIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY  
Evaluate whether obligations, rights, and processes clearly assign responsibility.  
Consider:  
- Obligations without a clearly identified responsible party  
- Shared responsibilities lacking coordination or decision authority  
- Processes described without ownership or control  
  
Identify gaps where accountability is unclear or assumed.  
  
2. OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT REMEDIES OR CONSEQUENCES  
Evaluate whether obligations are paired with consequences.  
Consider:  
- Rights without enforcement mechanisms  
- Breaches without remedies or escalation paths  
- Duties that exist without any consequence for non-performance  
  
Surface gaps where obligations exist but lack operational effect.  
  
3. MISSING INTERACTION AND PRIORITY RULES  
Evaluate how provisions interact.  
Consider:  
- Clauses that may conflict without a resolution mechanism  
- Absence of order-of-precedence rules  
- Silence about which provision controls in edge cases  
  
Identify gaps where the document provides no way to resolve internal collisions.  
  
4. UNADDRESSED TRANSITIONS AND EDGE CASES  
Evaluate whether foreseeable transitions are covered.  
Consider:  
- Onboarding and offboarding  
- Suspension, pause, or interruption states  
- Partial performance or failure scenarios  
- Change-of-control, assignment, or succession events  
  
Use scenario-style reasoning (“What happens if X occurs?”) to identify silence.  
  
5. PROCEDURAL INCOMPLETENESS  
Evaluate whether described procedures are executable.  
Consider:  
- Required approvals without identifying who approves  
- Required notices without method, timing, or recipient  
- Review processes without timelines  
- Conditions without clear satisfaction criteria  
  
Surface procedures that cannot be followed as written.  
  
6. UNDEFINED OR ORPHANED CONCEPTS  
Evaluate whether important concepts are fully specified.  
Consider:  
- Terms or concepts used but never defined  
- Provisions that begin but do not fully specify outcomes  
- Assumptions implicit in the text but never stated  
  
Identify gaps where meaning or operation is incomplete.  
  
7. INCORPORATED DOCUMENT DEPENDENCY LOAD  
For documents incorporating other materials by reference, evaluate cumulative impact.  
Consider:  
- Number and scope of incorporated documents  
- Accessibility to the intended audience  
- Version control and changeability over time  
- Whether incorporated materials can be modified unilaterally  
- Whether conflicts between documents can be resolved  
  
Surface gaps where incorporation creates hidden complexity or uncertainty.  
  
8. LIFECYCLE ENDPOINTS AND AFTEREFFECTS  
Evaluate whether document endpoints are complete.  
Consider:  
- Termination or expiration without defined effects  
- Survival of obligations not addressed  
- Data, asset, or work-product handling after termination  
  
Identify incomplete lifecycle treatment.  
  
9. SILENCE THAT CREATES ASYMMETRIC RISK  
Evaluate whether omissions disproportionately benefit one party.  
Consider:  
- Unilateral discretion enabled by silence  
- Missing protections for weaker parties  
- Absence of mutuality in critical mechanisms  
  
Surface gaps that create hidden imbalance through omission alone.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which completeness or gap analysis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 6:  
- COMPLETENESS.MISSING_RESPONSIBILITY  
- COMPLETENESS.NO_REMEDY_OR_CONSEQUENCE  
- COMPLETENESS.NO_PRIORITY_RULE  
- COMPLETENESS.UNADDRESSED_EDGE_CASE  
- COMPLETENESS.PROCEDURE_NOT_EXECUTABLE  
- COMPLETENESS.UNDEFINED_CONCEPT  
- COMPLETENESS.INCORPORATION_COMPLEXITY  
- COMPLETENESS.INCOMPLETE_LIFECYCLE  
- COMPLETENESS.ASYMMETRIC_SILENCE  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not assess fairness, legality, or compliance.  
- Do not infer intent beyond the text.  
- Do not propose missing clauses or fixes.  
- Do not repeat clarity or structural issues addressed in earlier passes.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- Critical gaps render the document operationally unworkable, OR  
- Silence creates substantial uncertainty that prevents reasonable reliance without expert intervention.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P6Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Clearly describe the missing element and its operational impact.  
- Use confidence levels reflecting certainty based on the document content.
