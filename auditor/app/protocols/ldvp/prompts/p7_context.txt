EXECUTE PASS 7: RISK & COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT  
  
Your objective is to identify risk indicators and potential compliance concerns that warrant expert legal review, based on the document’s structure, allocations, and operative effects.  
  
This pass does not determine legality, enforceability, or regulatory compliance. All findings are advisory risk signals only.  
  
The emphasis and heuristics applied must adapt to the DocumentCategory identified in Pass 1.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. ONE-SIDED OBLIGATIONS AND STRUCTURAL ASYMMETRY  
Evaluate whether obligations, rights, and discretion are materially imbalanced.  
Consider:  
- Disproportionate duties imposed on one party  
- Unilateral modification or termination rights  
- Unilateral discretion without meaningful constraints  
- Obligations triggered without reciprocal benefit  
  
Surface risk indicators of structural imbalance.  
  
2. FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE AND COMMITMENT TRAPS  
Evaluate financial commitment structures.  
Consider:  
- Non-cancelable or non-refundable fees  
- Automatic renewal mechanisms  
- Variable pricing or usage-based escalation  
- Financial penalties disproportionate to foreseeable harm  
- Commitments triggered by events outside a party’s control  
  
Identify risk indicators where financial exposure may be difficult to anticipate or exit.  
  
3. EXIT RIGHTS AND TERMINATION SYMMETRY  
Evaluate termination and exit mechanics.  
Consider:  
- Asymmetry in termination for convenience  
- Disparities in notice periods or cure rights  
- Punitive or one-sided termination fees  
- Survival of financial obligations post-termination  
- Data, asset, or service transition barriers  
  
Surface risks where exit is functionally constrained or financially coercive.  
  
4. LOGICAL AND CONDITIONAL RISK STRUCTURES (CRITICAL SIGNALS)  
Evaluate complex conditional logic that may create hidden risk.  
Consider:  
- Broken “if–then” structures where triggers no longer function  
- Conditions precedent that are impossible, already satisfied, or internally contradictory  
- Clauses labeled as “mutual” that are substantively non-reciprocal  
- Exceptions, carve-outs, or “subject to” clauses that swallow the primary rule  
  
These issues are often missed in review and should be treated as high-signal risk indicators.  
  
5. SUBSTANTIVE INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS THE DOCUMENT  
Evaluate whether substantively similar concepts are treated inconsistently.  
Consider:  
- Inconsistent standards of effort applied to similar obligations  
- Divergent thresholds, notice periods, or cure periods without clear rationale  
- Rights granted in one section and materially limited or negated elsewhere  
  
Surface risks of dispute or unenforceability arising from internal inconsistency.  
  
6. DATA, PRIVACY, AND INFORMATION RISK (WHEN APPLICABLE)  
Evaluate provisions affecting data and information handling.  
Consider:  
- Broad or ambiguous data use rights  
- Unclear ownership or control of data or work product  
- Security commitments misaligned with sensitivity or risk  
- Asymmetric audit, access, or inspection rights  
  
Surface indicators of heightened confidentiality or data risk.  
  
7. REGULATORY AND JURISDICTIONAL RISK SIGNALS  
Identify clauses that may intersect with regulated or jurisdiction-sensitive domains.  
Examples:  
- Consumer protection, employment, or financial services  
- Health, education, or minors  
- Cross-border data transfer or international operations  
- Choice of law or forum selection provisions  
  
Do not assess compliance. Flag areas likely requiring specialist review.  
  
8. CONTEXT-SENSITIVE FAIRNESS AND ADHESION RISK  
Based on document category and audience:  
Evaluate whether the structure raises fairness concerns.  
Consider:  
- Adhesion contracts with limited or no negotiation  
- Power imbalances between parties  
- Vulnerable or dependent counterparties  
  
For non-negotiable B2B agreements, assess risks such as:  
- Financial commitment traps  
- Unilateral change rights  
- Automatic escalation of obligations  
- Absence of meaningful service level or quality floors  
  
Frame all findings as risk indicators, not conclusions.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which risk or compliance analysis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 7:  
- RISK.ONE_SIDED_OBLIGATIONS  
- RISK.FINANCIAL_COMMITMENT_TRAP  
- RISK.EXIT_ASYMMETRY  
- RISK.CONDITIONAL_LOGIC_FAILURE  
- RISK.SUBSTANTIVE_INCONSISTENCY  
- RISK.DATA_PRIVACY_EXPOSURE  
- RISK.REGULATORY_TOUCHPOINT  
- RISK.ADHESION_OR_FAIRNESS_SIGNAL  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not state that any provision is illegal, unenforceable, or non-compliant.  
- Do not provide legal advice or recommendations.  
- Do not recommend acceptance or rejection.  
- Do not assess usability or clarity.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- Risk indicators suggest immediate expert escalation is necessary, OR  
- Structural risk or asymmetry appears materially severe.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P7Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Frame all findings as risks requiring human evaluation.  
- Use confidence levels to reflect strength of the signal.
