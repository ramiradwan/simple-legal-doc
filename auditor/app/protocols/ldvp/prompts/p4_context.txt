EXECUTE PASS 4: STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY CHECK  
  
Your objective is to evaluate whether the document’s internal structure is mechanically sound, internally consistent, and navigable as a legal instrument.  
  
This pass examines the document’s architecture only. It does not assess factual accuracy, clarity, fairness, legal enforceability, or risk.  
  
Structural defects must be identified before accuracy or risk analysis, because broken references, missing components, or unstable dependencies undermine all downstream verification.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. OVERALL DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION  
Evaluate whether the document is organized in a coherent and logical structure.  
Consider:  
- Logical sequencing of sections and subsections  
- Consistency of hierarchical structure  
- Accuracy and descriptiveness of section headings  
- Alignment between headings and the content they introduce  
  
Surface issues where organization impairs navigation or interpretation.  
  
2. CROSS-REFERENCE INTEGRITY  
Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of internal references.  
Consider:  
- Section and subsection references  
- Exhibit, schedule, or appendix citations  
- Forward and backward references  
- Orphaned or circular references  
  
Identify broken, missing, or ambiguous references that prevent reliable navigation.  
  
3. NUMBERING AND LABELING CONSISTENCY  
Evaluate whether numbering and labeling systems are consistent.  
Consider:  
- Sequential numbering of sections and subsections  
- Duplicate, skipped, or inconsistent numbering  
- Consistency in exhibit and schedule labels  
- Formatting inconsistencies affecting citation clarity  
  
Surface defects that create confusion or ambiguity.  
  
4. DEFINITION MANAGEMENT AND TERM CONSISTENCY  
Evaluate the document’s definition structure.  
Consider:  
- Capitalized terms that are never defined  
- Defined terms that are never used  
- Conflicting or overlapping definitions  
- Structural drift between a term’s definition and its usage  
  
Identify definition issues that impair structural coherence.  
  
5. EXTERNAL REFERENCE FRAGILITY (HIGH-RISK STRUCTURAL SIGNALS)  
  
A. URL AND HYPERLINK DEPENDENCIES  
Evaluate reliance on external links.  
Consider:  
- Whether core obligations or definitions depend on external URLs  
- Accessibility of linked content to intended users  
- Whether links appear stable or subject to unilateral change  
- Consequences if external content becomes unavailable or changes  
  
Surface concerns where external links undermine document stability.  
  
B. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  
Evaluate structural incorporation of external documents.  
Consider:  
- Whether incorporation is explicit and unambiguous  
- Accessibility of incorporated documents  
- Presence or absence of version identifiers  
- Risk of unilateral modification through incorporated materials  
- Circular or cascading incorporation  
  
Identify structural risks created by unclear or unstable incorporation.  
  
C. DYNAMIC OR SELF-UPDATING REFERENCES  
Evaluate references to materials that may change over time.  
Consider:  
- Use of terms like “current,” “as updated,” or “as amended”  
- Whether such references grant unilateral change power  
- Whether notice or consent mechanisms are structurally specified  
  
Surface issues where document meaning may change outside the document itself.  
  
6. COMPLETENESS OF REFERENCED PARTS  
Evaluate whether all referenced components are present.  
Consider:  
- Missing exhibits, schedules, or appendices  
- Referenced sections that do not exist  
- Incomplete signature blocks  
- Missing identification of required parties  
  
Surface missing structural elements that prevent full interpretation.  
  
7. INTERNAL STRUCTURAL CONSISTENCY  
Evaluate whether different sections align structurally.  
Consider:  
- Conflicting procedural frameworks  
- Inconsistent structural assumptions  
- Provisions that presuppose missing sections or definitions  
  
Identify contradictions that impair structural coherence, even if content is intelligible in isolation.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which structural integrity check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 4:  
- STRUCTURE.ORGANIZATION_INCOHERENT  
- STRUCTURE.CROSS_REFERENCE_BROKEN  
- STRUCTURE.NUMBERING_INCONSISTENT  
- STRUCTURE.DEFINITION_INCONSISTENT  
- STRUCTURE.UNDEFINED_TERM  
- STRUCTURE.UNUSED_DEFINITION  
- STRUCTURE.EXTERNAL_LINK_DEPENDENCY  
- STRUCTURE.INCORPORATION_BY_REFERENCE_RISK  
- STRUCTURE.DYNAMIC_REFERENCE_RISK  
- COMPLETENESS.MISSING_COMPONENT  
- STRUCTURE.INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not assess factual accuracy, legal compliance, or enforceability.  
- Do not assess usability or linguistic clarity.  
- Do not propose fixes or restructuring plans.  
- Do not weigh risk or fairness.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- Structural defects prevent reliable navigation or interpretation, OR  
- Critical external dependencies or missing components undermine structural integrity.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P4Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Clearly identify the structural defect and its location.  
- Use confidence levels reflecting certainty based on document inspection.
