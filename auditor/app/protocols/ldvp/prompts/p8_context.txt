EXECUTE PASS 8: SYNTHESIS OF UNRESOLVED SIGNALS  
  
Your objective is to surface unresolved issues, compounding risks, and communication concerns based on prior passes, without determining readiness.  
  
This pass does not assess legal validity, enforceability, or suitability for delivery. It provides an advisory synthesis of risk signals only.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. CONSOLIDATION OF STOP CONDITIONS  
Aggregate all findings from Passes 2 through 7 where metadata.stop_condition = true.  
Evaluate:  
- The cumulative impact of these unresolved stop conditions.  
- Whether their combined presence creates compounding risks.  
  
Do not reassess underlying issues; rely strictly on prior pass findings.  
  
2. COMPOUNDING RISK FACTORS  
Evaluate whether risks from different domains intersect to create greater exposure.  
Consider:  
- Structural fragility combined with UX failures.  
- Vague clarity combined with severe financial commitment traps.  
- Ambiguous scope combined with missing transition mechanics.  
  
Surface risks where the sum of the issues is greater than the individual parts.  
  
3. MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS  
Identify the absence of fundamental mechanical elements required for a complete legal instrument.  
Consider:  
- Outstanding placeholders, brackets, or [TBD] items.  
- Missing or incomplete signature blocks.  
- Unidentified parties.  
- Blank dates or missing schedules/exhibits.  
  
Surface these as mechanical gaps, not as delivery failures.  
  
4. PROFESSIONAL AND COMMUNICATION RISK SIGNALS  
Evaluate tone, presentation, and representational risks.  
Consider:  
- Inflammatory, inappropriate, or coercive language.  
- Misleading representations or ethical boundary concerns.  
- Formatting defects that severely impact professional presentation.  
  
Flag advisory concerns only.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which synthesis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 8:  
- DELIVERY.STOP_CONDITION_ACCUMULATION  
- DELIVERY.COMPOUNDING_RISK  
- DELIVERY.MISSING_CRITICAL_COMPONENT  
- DELIVERY.PROFESSIONAL_COMMUNICATION_RISK  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY):  
- Do not assess readiness or suitability for delivery.  
- Do not approve, reject, or gate the document.  
- Do not state that the document is legally valid, compliant, or approved.  
- Do not provide an overall readiness score, status, or recommendation.  
- Do not override or re-argue findings from earlier passes.  
- Do not provide legal advice or propose fixes.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P8Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Frame all output strictly as advisory synthesis signals for human review.
