EXECUTE PASS 3: CLARITY & ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS  
  
Your objective is to identify linguistic, structural, and accessibility issues that impair comprehension, increase interpretive ambiguity, or create risk of misunderstanding.  
  
This pass focuses on how the document is written, not whether it is correct, complete, fair, or enforceable.  
  
Clarity issues identified here often require rewriting. Because rewriting changes the text, this pass intentionally occurs before deeper accuracy or risk verification.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. LANGUAGE APPROPRIATENESS FOR TARGET AUDIENCE  
Evaluate whether the language aligns with the sophistication and expectations of the intended audience identified in Pass 1.  
Consider:  
- Excessive legalese or jargon  
- Technical terminology used without explanation  
- Assumptions about legal or domain knowledge  
- Mismatch between audience and linguistic complexity  
  
Surface issues where language likely exceeds reasonable comprehension for the intended readers.  
  
2. SENTENCE-LEVEL CLARITY AND AMBIGUITY  
Evaluate sentence construction for:  
- Unnecessarily long or complex sentences  
- Ambiguous phrasing or structure  
- Modifier placement that could alter meaning  
- Passive voice that obscures agency or responsibility  
- Pronouns or references with unclear antecedents  
  
Identify provisions that could reasonably be interpreted in more than one way.  
  
3. PARAGRAPH AND SECTION COHERENCE  
Evaluate whether information is logically grouped and sequenced.  
Consider:  
- Abrupt topic shifts  
- Poor transitions between concepts  
- Redundant or circular explanations  
- Mixing unrelated obligations within a single provision  
  
Surface coherence issues that impair readability even if individual sentences are clear.  
  
4. READABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY SIGNALS  
Use readability indicators (e.g., sentence length, grade‑level proxies) as supporting signals only, not as determinative rules.  
Evaluate whether:  
- Overall complexity aligns with audience expectations  
- Critical obligations are written at an accessible level  
- High‑complexity language clusters around high‑risk provisions  
  
Where readability materially exceeds audience capacity, surface this as an accessibility concern.  
  
5. VAGUE OR ELASTIC TERMINOLOGY  
Identify chronically vague or elastic terms that create uncertainty.  
Examples include:  
- “reasonable,” “promptly,” “substantial,” “material,” “as necessary”  
- Undefined standards of effort  
- Open‑ended qualifiers without contextual anchors  
  
Evaluate whether such terms are constrained or create interpretive risk.  
  
6. FALSE PRECISION AND OVER‑SPECIFICATION  
Identify instances where language implies a level of certainty or precision unlikely to be achievable in practice.  
Consider:  
- Overly specific timelines or performance metrics  
- Pseudo‑scientific measurements for subjective concepts  
- Detailed specifications that increase brittleness rather than clarity  
  
Surface risks where false precision increases misunderstanding or dispute likelihood.  
  
7. ENUMERATIONS AND SCOPE IMPLICATIONS  
Evaluate lists and enumerations for unintended scope effects.  
Consider:  
- Whether lists appear exhaustive when they are not  
- Whether examples unintentionally narrow broader obligations  
- Absence of language clarifying illustrative versus exhaustive intent  
  
Surface risks where enumerations may create unintended exclusions.  
  
8. DEFINITIONS THAT APPEAR OBJECTIVE BUT ARE NOT  
Evaluate defined terms for practical applicability.  
Consider:  
- Definitions requiring specialized expertise to apply  
- Definitions that sound objective but are inherently subjective  
- Terms that cannot be consistently measured or operationalized  
  
Identify definitions that create false confidence or ambiguity in application.  
  
9. AGE‑APPROPRIATENESS AND MINORS (WHEN APPLICABLE)  
When the document explicitly targets or binds minors, or specifies a minimum age:  
Evaluate whether language is appropriate for that age group.  
Consider:  
- Overall readability relative to stated age  
- Clarity of critical obligations and consequences  
- Explanation of complex legal concepts  
- Presence or absence of parental involvement mechanisms where indicated  
  
Surface critical concerns where minors may not reasonably understand what they are agreeing to.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which clarity or accessibility analysis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 3:  
- CLARITY.LEGALESE_OR_JARGON_EXCESSIVE  
- CLARITY.AUDIENCE_LANGUAGE_MISMATCH  
- CLARITY.SENTENCE_AMBIGUITY  
- CLARITY.UNCLEAR_REFERENCES  
- CLARITY.PARAGRAPH_INCOHERENT  
- ACCESSIBILITY.READABILITY_TOO_HIGH  
- CLARITY.VAGUE_TERMS  
- CLARITY.FALSE_PRECISION  
- CLARITY.ENUMERATION_SCOPE_RISK  
- CLARITY.DEFINITION_NOT_OPERATIONAL  
- ACCESSIBILITY.MINORS_NOT_APPROPRIATELY_ADDRESSED  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not verify factual accuracy or legal correctness.  
- Do not propose rewritten text or stylistic edits.  
- Do not assess usability or document format.  
- Do not assert legal invalidity or enforceability.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- Clarity failures create a material risk that core obligations or rights will be misunderstood, OR  
- The document binds minors using language far beyond reasonable comprehension for the stated age group.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P3Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Ensure each finding clearly describes the clarity or ambiguity risk and its potential impact.  
- Use confidence levels reflecting certainty based on the text.
