EXECUTE PASS 5: ACCURACY VERIFICATION  
  
Your objective is to identify factual, logical, and internal consistency issues within the document, while explicitly separating verifiable internal accuracy from external authorities that require human confirmation.  
  
This pass is limited to accuracy signals only. It does not assess usability, clarity, fairness, legal enforceability, or compliance.  
  
THIS PASS OPERATES IN TWO TIERS:  
  
TIER 1: INTERNAL ACCURACY (HIGH CONFIDENCE)  
You may analyze and flag issues that can be verified using only the content of the document itself.  
  
TIER 2: EXTERNAL AUTHORITY REFERENCES (HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED)  
You must not verify the correctness or current validity of external legal or factual authorities. Instead, you must identify and catalogue them for human review, clearly indicating uncertainty.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. INTERNAL FACTUAL CONSISTENCY (TIER 1)  
Evaluate whether factual statements are consistent across the document.  
Consider:  
- Contradictory descriptions of the same obligation or right  
- Inconsistent party names, roles, or identifiers  
- Conflicting definitions or factual assertions  
- Statements that cannot simultaneously be true  
  
Surface inconsistencies that create ambiguity or error.  
  
2. DEFINED TERM USAGE AND DRIFT (TIER 1)  
Evaluate whether defined terms are used correctly.  
Consider:  
- Capitalized terms used inconsistently with their definitions  
- Drift between a term’s defined meaning and later usage  
- Use of defined terms before definition or after deletion  
  
Identify misuse that creates factual or logical inconsistency.  
  
3. MATHEMATICAL AND LOGICAL ACCURACY (TIER 1)  
Evaluate internal calculations and logical relationships.  
Consider:  
- Arithmetic or percentage errors  
- Fee calculations that conflict with stated examples  
- Circular logic or logical impossibilities  
- Conditions that cannot be satisfied as written  
  
Identify errors conclusively determinable from the text.  
  
4. TEMPORAL AND DATE LOGIC (TIER 1)  
Evaluate whether dates, timelines, and temporal relationships are internally coherent.  
Consider:  
- Start and end dates  
- Notice and cure periods  
- Survival clauses and duration terms  
- Dependencies between dates and triggering events  
  
Identify temporal conflicts or impossible sequences.  
  
5. VERSIONING AND OBSOLESCENCE SIGNALS (TIER 1 — HIGH RISK)  
Evaluate whether the document reflects outdated assumptions.  
Consider:  
- References to repealed or replaced regulatory regimes  
- Obsolete agency names, standards, or programs  
- Arbitration or procedural rules tied to outdated versions  
- Clauses drafted for business, technical, or regulatory realities that no longer exist  
- Time mechanics that reference deleted events or defunct processes  
  
Flag signals of copy‑paste drift or temporal mismatch.  
  
6. BOILERPLATE AND TEMPLATE DRIFT (TIER 1)  
Evaluate whether standard clauses align with the apparent transaction.  
Consider:  
- Boilerplate assuming a different deal structure  
- Survival, assignment, or amendment clauses that conflict with bespoke terms  
- Jurisdiction or enforcement provisions incompatible with governing law  
- “Transaction‑type ghosts” revealing prior template history  
  
Identify internal mismatches suggesting template misuse.  
  
7. INTERNAL CROSS‑REFERENCE ACCURACY (TIER 1)  
Evaluate whether internal references are correct.  
Consider:  
- Section, exhibit, or schedule references that do not exist  
- Incorrect citations to other provisions  
- References that point to unrelated or contradictory sections  
  
Surface verifiable reference errors.  
  
8. EXTERNAL LEGAL AND REGULATORY REFERENCES (TIER 2)  
Identify all references to external authorities, including:  
- Statutes, regulations, or directives  
- Case law  
- Arbitration or procedural rules  
- Industry standards  
- External policies incorporated by reference  
  
Do NOT assess correctness or currency.  
Instead:  
- Identify each reference and its location  
- Describe the context of reliance  
- Flag for human verification  
- Assign LOW confidence due to external dependency  
  
9. EXTERNAL FACTUAL ASSERTIONS (TIER 2)  
Identify factual claims that rely on information outside the document.  
Examples:  
- Regulatory requirements  
- Market or industry facts  
- Technical capabilities  
- Third‑party representations  
  
Flag these for human review without judging accuracy.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which accuracy verification check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 5:  
  
TIER 1 – INTERNAL ACCURACY  
- ACCURACY.INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION  
- ACCURACY.DEFINED_TERM_DRIFT  
- ACCURACY.MATHEMATICAL_ERROR  
- ACCURACY.LOGICAL_IMPOSSIBILITY  
- ACCURACY.TEMPORAL_INCONSISTENCY  
- ACCURACY.OBSOLETE_REFERENCE_SIGNAL  
- ACCURACY.BOILERPLATE_DRIFT  
- ACCURACY.CROSS_REFERENCE_ERROR  
  
TIER 2 – EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES  
- ACCURACY.EXTERNAL_LEGAL_REFERENCE  
- ACCURACY.EXTERNAL_FACTUAL_ASSERTION  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not verify or opine on legal compliance.  
- Do not assert whether external law is current or applicable.  
- Do not speculate beyond the document.  
- Clearly distinguish Tier 1 findings from Tier 2 findings through description and confidence.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- Internal accuracy failures materially undermine the document’s reliability, OR  
- Extensive external dependencies require comprehensive human legal review before reliance.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P5Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Use LOW confidence for all Tier 2 findings.  
- Clearly explain why Tier 2 items require human verification.
