EXECUTE PASS 2: USER EXPERIENCE & USABILITY ANALYSIS  
  
Your objective is to evaluate whether the document’s format, structure, and presentation pragmatically support the intended users’ real‑world workflows and decision‑making needs.  
  
This pass focuses on usability and interaction design, not linguistic clarity, factual accuracy, legal compliance, or enforceability.  
  
Issues identified here often require format or structural changes. Because such changes alter how the document is used, this pass intentionally occurs before clarity and accuracy analysis.  
  
ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS:  
  
1. DOCUMENT FORMAT AND MEDIUM APPROPRIATENESS  
Evaluate whether the chosen format aligns with how the intended audience is expected to engage with the document.  
Consider:  
- Whether the medium (e.g., dense PDF, static text, form agreement) matches user context and capacity  
- Whether document length is appropriate for its purpose  
- Whether effective use requires simultaneous reference to multiple documents  
- Whether the format enables or obstructs required user actions  
  
Surface critical concerns where the format itself prevents meaningful use or compliance.  
  
2. FINDABILITY AND NAVIGATION  
Evaluate whether users can efficiently locate critical information without reading the entire document.  
Consider:  
- Presence and quality of navigational structure (tables of contents, headers, numbering)  
- Logical organization of sections  
- Visibility of key obligations, rights, deadlines, and consequences  
- Whether critical provisions are buried in dense or obscure sections  
  
Flag situations where important commitments are difficult to discover.  
  
3. ACTIONABILITY AND TASK CLARITY  
Evaluate whether users can determine:  
- What actions they are required to take  
- When those actions must occur  
- Who is responsible for each action  
- What happens if actions are not taken  
  
Identify failures where users cannot reasonably determine how to comply in practice.  
  
4. REAL‑WORLD USER JOURNEYS AND PRACTICALITY  
Evaluate whether the document supports realistic use scenarios.  
Consider:  
- Whether assumptions about user knowledge, resources, or coordination are reasonable  
- Whether obligations are practically achievable  
- Whether common or foreseeable scenarios are addressed  
- Whether the document reflects how it would actually be used over time  
  
Surface usability risks where compliance appears impractical or unrealistic.  
  
5. MULTI‑STAKEHOLDER USABILITY  
Evaluate whether the document serves all relevant audiences.  
Consider:  
- Primary users (e.g., consumers, employees, customers)  
- Secondary stakeholders (e.g., internal operators, compliance teams, regulators)  
  
Identify situations where the document is optimized for one stakeholder at severe expense to others, creating operational or compliance friction.  
  
6. LEGAL DESIGN AND USER‑CENTERED STRUCTURE  
Evaluate the document against modern legal design principles.  
Consider:  
- Whether the structure is user‑centered or lawyer‑centered  
- Whether critical information is appropriately emphasized  
- Whether complex concepts are presented in a way users can practically navigate  
  
Surface usability concerns where design choices materially impair understanding or execution.  
  
7. FINANCIAL COMMITMENT PROMINENCE (WHEN APPLICABLE)  
For documents involving payment or financial obligation, evaluate whether financial commitments are transparently and prominently disclosed.  
Consider:  
- Visibility of payment amounts and fee structures  
- Prominence of non‑cancelable or non‑refundable terms  
- Clarity of automatic renewal provisions  
- Disclosure of variable, usage‑based, or escalating fees  
- Whether users can reasonably estimate total cost from the document alone  
  
Flag critical concerns where financial obligations are obscured, fragmented, or buried in non‑obvious locations.  
  
RULE IDENTIFICATION (REQUIRED):  
  
For each finding, select exactly one rule_id from the list below.  
The rule_id identifies which usability analysis check produced the finding.  
Do not invent new rule identifiers.  
  
Allowed rule_id values for Pass 2:  
- UX.FORMAT_MEDIUM_MISMATCH  
- UX.LENGTH_OR_DENSITY_EXCESSIVE  
- UX.NAVIGATION_DEFICIENT  
- UX.KEY_INFORMATION_HARD_TO_FIND  
- UX.ACTIONS_UNCLEAR  
- UX.DEADLINES_OR_CONSEQUENCES_UNCLEAR  
- UX.COMPLIANCE_IMPRACTICAL  
- UX.UNREALISTIC_USER_ASSUMPTIONS  
- UX.MULTI_STAKEHOLDER_FRICTION  
- UX.LEGAL_DESIGN_POOR  
- UX.FINANCIAL_TERMS_OBSCURED  
  
Each finding must map to the single most relevant rule_id.  
  
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:  
- Do not assess linguistic clarity, factual accuracy, legal compliance, or enforceability.  
- Do not score, rate, or rank usability.  
- Do not propose specific redesigns or fixes.  
- Do not assert unconscionability or legal invalidity.  
- Frame all observations as usability and user‑risk signals requiring human review.  
  
STOP CONDITION SIGNALS (ADVISORY ONLY):  
Set metadata.stop_condition = true if:  
- The document format is fundamentally mismatched to the intended audience and requires structural redesign, OR  
- Critical usability failures make it impossible for users to identify required actions or comply in practice.  
  
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:  
- Emit findings only via the P2Output schema.  
- Each finding MUST include a rule_id selected from the allowed list.  
- Ensure each finding includes severity, confidence, and rationale.
