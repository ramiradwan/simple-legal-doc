# connector/requirements.txt
#
# Runtime dependencies for the simple-legal-doc MCP connector.
#
# Kept intentionally minimal. The connector is a thin HTTP relay and
# must not pull in backend dependencies (LaTeX tooling, cryptographic
# libraries, etc.) that would inflate startup time or introduce
# libraries that write to stdout.
#
# Pydantic is intentionally absent as a direct dependency. It is a
# transitive dependency pulled in by the mcp package and requires no
# explicit pin here.
#
# Install into a dedicated virtual environment:
#   python -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
#   venv\Scripts\activate.bat         # Windows
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Use the absolute path to the venv's python executable in
# claude_desktop_config.json, not the system python or an activation
# shim. Claude Desktop does not execute shell activation scripts.
